      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must

          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one

          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Developer may provide Beta Testers with its own EULA for a Beta Application that will be accessed by Beta Testers (“Developer EULA”​); provided that the Developer EULA provides terms and conditions consistent with this Agreement and, with respect to Crashlytics, no less protective than those terms and conditions set forth in the standard EULA provided in Appendix A (“Standard EULA”)​. If Developer does not provide a separate Developer EULA to Beta Testers that is applicable to Developer’s Beta Application, then Developer acknowledges and agrees that such Beta Testers’ use of the Beta Application shall be subject to the Standard EULA. Developer acknowledges and agrees that Crashlytics provides the Standard EULA by way of convenience only, and does not represent or warrant that the Standard EULA will be enforceable under, or in compliance with, all applicable laws, rules, regulations, or otherwise. Developer acknowledges and agrees that the EULA applicable to Developer’s Beta Application shall be between Developer and any Beta Tester, and Crashlytics shall not be responsible for, and shall not have any liability whatsoever for, such EULA, any application tested by a Beta Tester, or for any breach by Developer or any Beta Tester of the terms and conditions of such EULA. The Services allow the Developer to collect information relating to performance of Developer’s applications, including, without limitation, device state information, unique device identifiers, information relating to the physical location of a device, and information about how the application was used. Developer may turn on features of the Services to allow collection of other information via the Services, including some personally identifiable information (e.g., a user’s e­mail address), which allows Developers to communicate with users about the engagement with and functionality of their applications and to invite them to become Beta Testers. Developer represents and warrants that Developer is collecting information via the Services solely to obtain information about the user engagement with and functionality of Developer’s applications, and to communicate with users about such engagement and functionality. Developer agrees that it will not enable collection of personally identifiable information via the Services unless it is necessary to communicate with users about the applications or Developer wishes to invite users to be Beta Testers and the user has provided affirmative consent to the collection and use of such information. Subject to and without limiting the foregoing, Developer agrees it will not enable collection or use of credit card information, Social Security numbers, driver’s license numbers, dates of birth or physical addresses via the Services. Developer further agrees it will not integrate the Software into any Application or Beta Application (i) with end users who Developer has actual knowledge are under the age of 13, or (ii) that may be deemed to be a “Web site or online service directed to children” as defined under the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (“COPPA​”) and the regulations promulgated thereunder. At all times during the term of this Agreement, Developer shall maintain a privacy policy (a) that is readily accessible to users from its website or within its online service (as applicable), (b) that fully and accurately discloses to its users what information is collected about its users, and (c) that states that such information is disclosed to and processed by third party providers like Crashlytics in the manner contemplated by the Services, including, without limitation, disclosure of the use of technology to track users’ activity and otherwise collect information from users. For Developer’s users in the European Union, Developer shall provide such users with clear notice of, and obtain such users’ consent to, the transfer, storage, and use of their information in the United States and any other country where Crashlytics, or any third ­party service providers acting on its behalf, operates, and shall further notify such users that the privacy and data protection laws in some of these countries may vary from the laws in the country where such users live. Developer shall at all times comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations relating to data collection, privacy and security, including without limitation COPPA. Crashlytics may, at its sole discretion from time to time during the Term of this Agreement, audit Developer Data to verify compliance.

2.7 Developer Systems​. Developer is responsible for providing (a) all equipment, subscriptions and credentials necessary for Crashlytics to receive the Developer Data, and (b) all modems, servers, devices, storage, software (other than Software), databases, network and communications equipment and ancillary services needed to connect to, access, or otherwise use the Services at its facility (collectively, “Developer Systems”)​. Developer shall ensure that Developer Systems are compatible with the Services and comply with all configurations and specifications described in the Documentation.

2.8 Limitations​. Crashlytics will not be responsible or liable for any failures in the Services or any other problems which are related to (a) the Developer Data or Developer Systems, or (b) any satellite, telecommunications, network or other equipment or service outside of Crashlytics’s facilities or control.

2.9 Confidentiality. “Confidential Information” ​means any information disclosed by one party (“Discloser​”) to the other party (“Recipient”​) that is marked or otherwise identified as “confidential” or “proprietary,” or by its nature or the circumstances of disclosure should reasonably be understood to be confidential, including without limitation, all financial, business or technical information disclosed in relation to this Agreement. Except for the specific rights granted by this Agreement, the Recipient may not use, copy or disclose any Confidential Information of the ​Discloser without Discloser’s prior written consent, and shall use no less than reasonable care to safeguard Discloser’s Confidential Information, including ensuring that Recipient’s employees, contractors and agents (“Representatives”)​with access to Discloser’s Confidential Information have a need to know such Confidential Information for the purposes of this Agreement and are bound by confidentiality obligations no less protective of the parties as those set forth herein. The foregoing obligations shall not apply to any Confidential Information that Recipient can demonstrate is (a) already known by it without restriction, (b) rightfully furnished to it without restriction by a third party not in breach of any obligation to Discloser, (c) generally available to the public without breach of this Agreement or (d) independently developed by it without reference to or use of any of Discloser’s Confidential Information and without any violation of any obligation of this Agreement. Each party shall be responsible for any breach of confidentiality by its Representatives, as applicable. Promptly upon Discloser’s request at any time, Recipient shall, or in the case of Developer Data shall use reasonable efforts to, return all of Discloser’s tangible Confidential Information, permanently erase all Confidential Information from any storage media and destroy all information, records, copies, summaries, analyses and materials developed therefrom. Nothing herein shall prevent a party from disclosing any of the other’s Confidential Information as necessary pursuant to any court order or any legal, regulatory, law enforcement or similar requirement or investigation; provided, however, prior to any such disclosure, Recipient shall use reasonable efforts to (i) promptly notify Discloser in writing of such requirement to disclose where permitted by law, and (ii) cooperate with Discloser in protecting against or minimizing any such disclosure and/or obtaining a protective order.

SECTION 4. WARRANTY, LIABILITY & INDEMNITY

4.1 Warranties​. Crashlytics represents and warrants that it has full right, power, and authority to enter into this Agreement and to perform its obligations and duties under this Agreement, and that the performance of such obligations and duties does not conflict with or result in a breach of any other agreement of Crashlytics, or any judgment, order, or decree by which such party is bound.

Developer is solely responsible for defending any such Crashlytics Claims, subject to Crashlytics’s right to participate with counsel of its own choosing, and for payment of all judgments, settlements, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, resulting from such Claims against Crashlytics, provided that Developer will not agree to any settlement related to any such Crashlytics Claims without Crashlytics’s prior express written consent regardless of whether or not such settlement releases Crashlytics from any obligation or liability. If Developer uses the Services in an official capacity as an employee or representative of a United States federal, state, or local government entity and is legally unable to accept this indemnification provision, then it does not apply to such entity, but only to the extent as required by applicable law.

4.4​ Claims Against Developer​. Crashlytics will defend the Developer from all third party claims, actions, suits, or proceedings, whether actual or alleged (collectively, “Developer Claims”), and will indemnify Developer and hold Developer harmless from any and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) resulting from such Developer Claims, that arise out of an allegation that the Services, when used as expressly permitted by this Agreement, infringes the intellectual property rights of such third party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Crashlytics will have no obligation under this Section 4.4 or otherwise with respect to any infringement claim based upon: (a) any use of the Services not expressly permitted under this Agreement; (b) any use of the Services in combination with products, equipment, software, or data not made available by Crashlytics if such infringement would have been avoided without the combination with such other products, equipment, software, or data; (c) any modification of the Services by any person other than Crashlytics or its authorized agents or subcontractors; or (d) any claim not clearly based on the Services itself.

4.5 ​Procedure​. The foregoing obligations are conditioned on the party seeking indemnification: (a) promptly notifying the other party in writing of such claim; (b) giving the other party sole control of the defense thereof and any related settlement negotiations; and (c) cooperating and, at other party’s request and expense, assisting in such defense. Neither party may make any public announcement of any claim, defense or settlement without the other party’s prior written approval. The indemnifying party may not settle, compromise or resolve a claim without the consent of the indemnified party, if such settlement, compromise or resolution (x) causes or requires an admission or finding of guilt against the indemnified party, (y) imposes any monetary damages against the indemnified party, or (z) does not fully release the indemnified party from liability with respect to the claim.

4.6 Limitation of Liability. (a) ​IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, OR FOR ANY DAMAGES ASSOCIATED WITH ANY LOSS OF USE, BUSINESS, PROFITS, OR GOODWILL OR FOR INTERRUPTION, LOSS OR CORRUPTION OF DATA OR NETWORKS. (b)​ IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ANY AND ALL CLAIMS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED FIFTY ($50.00) DOLLARS (USD). (c) THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS SHALL NOT APPLY TO BREACHES OF CONFIDENTIALITY OBLIGATIONS OR FOR MISAPPROPRIATION OR INFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, AND SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ANY REMEDY PROVIDED HEREIN. THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS, EXCLUSIONS AND DISCLAIMERS SHALL APPLY TO ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH LIABILITY ARISES FROM ANY CLAIM BASED UPON CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGE. Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to You. INSOFAR AS APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS ANY LIMITATION ON LIABILITY HEREIN, THE PARTIES AGREE THAT SUCH LIMITATION WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY MODIFIED, BUT ONLY TO THE EXTENT SO AS TO MAKE THE LIMITATION COMPLIANT WITH APPLICABLE LAW.

SECTION 5. TERM AND TERMINATION

5.1 Term​. The term of this Agreement will begin on the date you first agree to this Agreement and are approved to register for the Services, and continue until terminated as set forth herein (“Term”​). Your use of the Services may be terminated by Crashlytics or you at any time, for any reason, effective immediately upon notice provided by one party to the other party as set forth herein.

5.2 Effects of Termination.​ Upon any expiration or termination of this Agreement, all rights, obligations and licenses of the parties shall cease, except that (a) all obligations that accrued prior to the effective date of termination and all remedies for breach of this Agreement shall survive, (b) you must discontinue accessing and using the Services and delete all Software, Crashlytics Properties, and Crashlytics Material, and (c) the provisions in Section 2 titled Restrictions, Developer Feedback, Confidentiality, Proprietary Rights, General Learning; Aggregate Data, the provisions of Section 4 and the provisions in this Section 5 shall survive. Crashlytics has no obligation to store, delete or return any User Feedback, Performance Data, Developer Data, or Results.

6. MISCELLANEOUS

6.1 Entire Agreement​. This Agreement (which includes any order form completed by Developer) constitutes the entire agreement, and supersede all prior negotiations, understandings, or agreements (oral or written), between the parties about the subject matter of this Agreement.

6.2 Waivers, Consents and Amendments.​ No waiver, consent, or modification of this Agreement shall bind the Crashlytics Entities unless in writing and signed by Crashlytics. Crashlytics may amend this Agreement from time to time. If we make a change to this Agreement that, in our sole discretion, is material, we will notify you at the email address that you provided upon signing up to access the Services or upon signing up to access the Crashlytics Fabric services, at crashlytics.com, or otherwise through the Services. If you do not agree to the modified terms, you shall notify Crashlytics in writing within thirty (30) days, after which your right to access and use the Services shall immediately terminate and the Crashlytics Entities shall have no further responsibility or liability to you. The failure of either party to enforce its rights under this Agreement at any time for any period will not be construed as a waiver of such rights.

6.3 Severability​. If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.

6.4 Governing Law and Disputes​. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflicts of law provisions. (a) Except as set forth in Section 6.4(b) below, all claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Services ("Disputes”) will be governed by California law, excluding California’s conflict of laws rules, and all Disputes will be litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, California, USA, and You and Crashlytics consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts. (b) If Your principal place of business (for entities) or place of residence (for individuals) is in any country within APAC (other than Australia, Japan, New Zealand or Singapore) or Latin America, this Section 6.4(b) will apply instead of Section 6.4(a) above. ALL DISPUTES (AS DEFINED ABOVE) WILL BE GOVERNED BY CALIFORNIA LAW, EXCLUDING CALIFORNIA’S CONFLICT OF LAWS RULES. The parties will try in good faith to settle any Dispute within 30 days after the Dispute arises. If the Dispute is not resolved within 30 days, it must be resolved by arbitration by the American Arbitration Association’s International Centre for Dispute Resolution in accordance with its Expedited Commercial Rules in force as of the date of this Agreement ("Rules"). The parties will mutually select one arbitrator. The arbitration will be conducted in English in Santa Clara County, California, USA. Either party may apply to any competent court for injunctive relief necessary to protect its rights pending resolution of the arbitration. The arbitrator may order equitable or injunctive relief consistent with the remedies and limitations in this Agreement. Subject to the confidentiality requirements in of this Agreement, either party may petition any competent court to issue any order necessary to protect that party's rights or property; this petition will not be considered a violation or waiver of this governing law and arbitration section and will not affect the arbitrator’s powers, including the power to review the judicial decision. The parties stipulate that the courts of Santa Clara County, California, USA, are competent to grant any order under this subsection. The arbitral award will be final and binding on the parties and its execution may be presented in any competent court, including any court with jurisdiction over either party or any of its property. Any arbitration proceeding conducted in accordance with this section will be considered Confidential Information under this Agreement's confidentiality section, including (i) the existence of, (ii) any information disclosed during, and (iii) any oral communications or documents related to the arbitration proceedings. The parties may also disclose the information described in this section to a competent court as may be necessary to file any order under this section or execute any arbitral decision, but the parties must request that those judicial proceedings be conducted in camera (in private). The parties will pay the arbitrator’s fees, the arbitrator's appointed experts' fees and expenses, and the arbitration center's administrative expenses in accordance with the Rules. In its final decision, the arbitrator will determine the non-prevailing party's obligation to reimburse the amount paid in advance by the prevailing party for these fees. Each party will bear its own lawyers’ and experts’ fees and expenses, regardless of the arbitrator’s final decision. (c) If Your principal place of business (for entities) or place of residence (for individuals) is in Greece, all Disputes (as defined above) will be governed by Greek law and the parties submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Athens in relation to any Dispute.

6.5 Force Majeure​. In the event that either party is prevented from performing, or is unable to perform, any of its obligations under this Agreement (except payment obligations) due to any cause beyond its reasonable control, the affected party shall give written notice thereof to the other party and its performance shall be extended for the period of delay or inability to perform due to such occurrence.

6.6 Notices​. Any notice or communication hereunder shall be in writing and either personally delivered or sent via confirmed facsimile, confirmed electronic transmission, recognized express delivery courier or certified or registered mail, prepaid and return receipt requested, addressed to the other party, which, in the case of Developer, shall be the email address provided to Crashlytics upon signing up for the Services or upon signing up to access the Crashlytics Fabric services, and, in the case of Crashlytics, shall be Google Inc. 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA, with a copy to Legal Department. All notices shall be in English, and deemed to have been received when they are hand delivered, or five business days after their mailing, or upon confirmed electronic transmission or confirmed facsimile transmission.

This Agreement and the rights and obligations hereunder may not be assigned, transferred or delegated, in whole or in part, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, contract, merger (whether Developer is the surviving or disappearing entity), stock or asset sale, consolidation, dissolution, through government action or otherwise, by Developer without Crashlytics’s prior written consent. Any assignment or transfer in violation of the foregoing shall automatically be null and void, and Crashlytics may immediately terminate this Agreement upon such an attempt. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, any permitted successors, representatives, and permitted assigns of the parties hereto.

6.8 Independent Contractors​. The parties shall be independent contractors under this Agreement, and nothing herein will constitute either party as the employer, employee, agent, or representative of the other party, or both parties as joint venturers or partners for any purpose.
